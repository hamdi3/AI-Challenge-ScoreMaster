Welcome to the AI Challenge Score Master GitHub repository! This project was a part pf a small project i made while teaching some students about the basics of AI so that they can have a fun competition.

## Background

The idea behind this project is inspired by my university and how we used to upload our models for automatic testing. I just made it simpler and more user friendly.

## Features

- A user can make an account or login.
- Once the user is logged, a model can be uploaded (Models that are trained on MNIST).
- Models are automatically evaluated.
- Results are visualized in a table (No login needed to view that table).
